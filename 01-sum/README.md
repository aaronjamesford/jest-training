### sum.js

Does as it says on the tin - exports a sum function

### sum-test.js

This is an example test. Showing the syntax used to describe a test.

A fixture is decalred with the `describe()` function.

The `jest.dontMock('../sum')` is telling Jest not to mock the sum module. More on this later.
