jest-training
=============

Jest (http://facebook.github.io/jest/) is the flavour of this tut. An introduction to javascript testing and some of the features that Jest has to offer.

When Jest is run (npm test) it automatically detects tests in the __tests__ directory and executes them.

## The tutorials

The tutorials here are contained into a seperate, numbered directory. Each directory has its own Readme to explain the purpose and tasks of the tutorial.

### 01-sum

There is nothing required to do here. A basic example of a test for the sum function.

### 02-automocks

This is an intro to the automatic mocking feature that Jest provides.
